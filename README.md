# Linked-List-Pointers-only-
This is a Linked List version based on pointers only; Still needs to be properly tested.
So, this is implemented by double pointer sizeof(char*)*2, which contains array of two other pointers, ptr[0], which has actual string value and ptr[1] which points to another array of two pointers;
